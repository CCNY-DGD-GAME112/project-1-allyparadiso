rules:

Score: Some action you can take makes a number go up. The score is displayed on screen.
- Maybe every zombie you shoot gives you 1 point
- Maybe you have 30 seconds of oxygen and need to pick up oxygen tanks to stay alive
- Maybe you collect keys, gaining 1 when you pick one up and losing 1 when you open a door

Timer: Something happens after a countdown or cooldown
- Maybe something bad spawns ever 3 seconds and the player has survive as long as possible
- Maybe the game ends after 30 seconds
- Maybe bad things spawn in faster the closer to the round’s end you get

Game Manager: An invisible script that handles jobs not tied to any one specific gameobject
- Your ‘Score’ text must only be set by the Game Manager
- This will feel a little annoying the first time, but is much easier in the long run

Also you can add anything else you can think of, but be sure you can make it in five weeks
